# Algebra 1 

## Benchmarking Quiz

Before we dive into the topics covered in this module, it's important to assess your current knowledge of Algebra 1. Take this benchmarking quiz to see how much you already know and to identify areas where you may need to focus your study.

Once you have completed the quiz, review your results and identify the topics where you scored the lowest. These topics will be important to focus on during the rest of the module.
In the Benchmarking Quiz, you will be asked a series of multiple-choice questions that cover a range of topics in Algebra 1. The quiz is designed to help you assess your current knowledge and identify areas where you may need to focus your study. Once you have completed the quiz, you will be able to review your results and see which topics you need to work on. This will help you get the most out of the rest of the module and be better prepared for future studies in Algebra 1.

[[?]] Use either the substitution or elimination method
[[?]] Solve for one variable and then find the other
[[?]] Check your solution by plugging the values back into the original equations

## Introduction

In this module, we will be learning the basics of Algebra 1, which is an important branch of mathematics that deals with variables, equations, and functions. This module is designed for 8th grade students who are new to Algebra 1 or need a refresher on the basics.

## Topics

### 1. Variables and Expressions

In this section, we will learn about variables and how to use them to write expressions. We will also learn how to simplify expressions by combining like terms and using the distributive property.

#### Quiz: Simplifying Expressions

Select one option question question: Which property of addition do you use to simplify the expression 3x + 2x?
[( )] Commutative Property
[(X)] Associative Property
[( )] Distributive Property
[( )] Identity Property

### 2. Solving Equations

In this section, we will learn how to solve equations with one variable by using inverse operations. We will also learn how to check our solutions to make sure they are valid.

#### Quiz: Solving Equations

Multiple possible options correct question: Solve for x: 2x + 3 = 7x - 5
[(X)] x = 2
[[ ]] x = 3
[[ ]] x = -3
[[X]] x = 4

### 3. Linear Equations

In this section, we will learn about linear equations and how to graph them using slope-intercept form. We will also learn how to write equations of lines given two points or a point and a slope.


Linear equations are algebraic equations where the highest power of the variable(s) is 1. These equations are commonly used to model relationships between variables in a variety of contexts.

### Slope-Intercept Form

The slope-intercept form of a linear equation is given by:

y = mx + b

where:
- m is the slope
- b is the y-intercept

#### Common Errors
- Students may confuse the slope and the y-intercept in the equation.
- Students might not simplify the equation before identifying the slope and the y-intercept.

#### Quiz

1. What is the slope of the equation `y = 4x - 3`?

   [( )] -4
   [(X)] 4
   [( )] -3
   [( )] 3

2. What is the y-intercept of the equation `y = -2x + 5`?

   [[5]]

3. Rewrite the following equation in slope-intercept form: `3x - 2y = 6`

   [[-3x/2 + 3]]

### Standard Form

The standard form of a linear equation is given by:

Ax + By = C

where:
- A, B, and C are integers
- A is non-negative
- A, B, and C have no common factors other than 1

#### Common Errors
- Students may not have A, B, and C as integers.
- Students might not ensure that A is non-negative.
- Students may not simplify the equation, leaving common factors in A, B, and C.

#### Quiz

1. Which of the following equations is in standard form?

   [( )] 2x + 3y = 0
   [(X)] 4x - 6y = 12
   [( )] -3x + 5y = 9
   [( )] 1.5x - 2y = 6

2. Rewrite the following equation in standard form: `y = 2x - 4`

   [[2x - y = -4]]

3. Convert the following standard form equation to slope-intercept form: `6x + 3y = 12`

   [[y = -2x + 4]]

#### Quiz: Writing Equations of Lines

Select one option question question: What is the slope-intercept form of the equation of the line that passes through the points (-2, 3) and (4, 1)?
[( )] y = 2x + 1
[( )] y = 2x - 5
[(X)] y = -1/3x + 7/3
[( )] y = -1/3x - 1/3

### 4. Systems of Equations

In this section, we will learn about systems of equations and how to solve them using substitution and elimination. We will also learn how to interpret the solution to a system of equations.

Multiple possible options correct question: Solve the system of equations:
-2x + y = 4
4x - 2y = -8
[[X]] x = -1, y = 2

[[X]] x = -2, y = 0

### 5. Quadratic Equations

In this section, we will learn about quadratic equations and how to graph them using vertex form. We will also learn how to solve quadratic equations using factoring, completing the square, and the quadratic formula.

#### Quiz: Solving Quadratic Equations

Select one option question question: What is the quadratic formula?
[(X)] x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a
[( )] x = -b / 2a
[( )] x = -b ± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)
[( )] x = (-b ± sqrt(b^2 + 4ac)) / 2a


## Quizzes

Throughout the module, there will be quizzes to test your knowledge on the topics we have covered. These quizzes will help you assess your understanding and identify areas where you may need to review.

## Active Learning Strategies

During the virtual lecture, we will use active learning strategies to engage with the material and deepen our understanding. These strategies may include group discussions, problem-solving activities, and interactive simulations.

## Conclusion

By the end of this module, you should have a strong foundation in Algebra 1 and be able to apply your knowledge to solve real-world problems.
